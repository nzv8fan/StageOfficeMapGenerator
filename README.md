# StageOfficeMapGenerator
An Office-Like Map Generator for Player/Stage. 

This repository is a collection of tools and notes for building Office-like Environment maps for Player/Stage.
These maps have been used in a number of research papers on sequential auctions for multi-robot task allocation problems. 

The maps generated by the application in the javaSrc directory guarantee that all rooms are accessible. 

# Map Generation 
java nz.net.brad.MapGenerator outputMap.png optionalMinimumNumberOfDoorsOpen

# Requirements

# Notes
generator.c in the cSrc directory creates SVG maps with no guarantee that all rooms are accessible.
